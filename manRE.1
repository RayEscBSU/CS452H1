 How to perform test - user runs test to be performed in main.c. 


Run 
       GNUmakefile must be in the parent directory 
       To run: 
              From directory where main.c is located    - make
                                                        -./deq

       To run valgrind: 
       From directory where main.c is located    - make valgrind                                         


DESCRIPTION
       Our assingment was to implement a double ended doubly linked list. Doulbe ended means the list can have
       the head or tail at iether end of the list. Double linked means each node has a pointer for its head and
       tail nodes. Valgrind was used to manage memory. Below are the functions implemented: 

              - Put - adds a node to the end of the list
              - ith - returns data at a specified index depnding on direction
              - Get - Returns the data from the last node
              - Rem - removes the node with matching data then removes node
